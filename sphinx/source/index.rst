Welcome to the Bone Physics documentation!
===========================================

**Bone Physics** is a Blender add-on designed for skeletal-based physics simulation in character animation,  
especially for **stylized or cartoon characters**.  
It is suitable for dynamic elements such as hair, ribbons, tails, and soft-body parts.

This add-on is developed on top of |blender_mmd_tools|.  
Its purpose is to port the MMD-style physics system into Blender as a standalone module,  
while providing full compatibility with Blender's built-in **Rigify** armature and other common rigging systems.

The add-on is open-source on |github| and distributed under the GPL-3 license.
You may choose to purchase it on |blender_market| to support its continued development.

Since the add-on is based on |blender_mmd_tools|,  
you can reference the physics setups found in many existing **MMD model files** to help configure your own models.

Check |youtube_link| or |bilibili_link| for video tutorials and complete workflow demonstrations.
